# Array Sorting in C/C++ 

This repository contains a C/C++ program designed to sort integer arrays efficiently. You can choose between ascending or descending order.

## Features

* **Sorting Algorithms:** Currently implements bubble sort (more to come in the future!).
* **User Input:** Accepts array size, elements, and sorting order from the user.
* **Error Handling:** Includes basic input validation to prevent crashes.
* **Clear Output:**  Provides a readable display of the sorted array.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [invalid URL removed]
   ```

2. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o array_sort main.c
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   ./array_sort
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter the array size, elements, and sorting order.

## Example

```
Enter the size of the array (max 100): 5
Enter the elements of the array:
4 1 3 2 5
Enter sorting order (A for Ascending, D for Descending): A
Sorted array in ascending order:
1 2 3 4 5 
```
